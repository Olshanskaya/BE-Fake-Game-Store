## About the Project

### Users Perspective

This website is a place where users can explore and buy games easily. 
Users can `browse` a list of games and `search` by genre, player support, or part of the gameâ€™s name.
Each game has a detailed page with more information.

New users can `create an account` using their email. 
After `signing up`, they must `confirm email` by clicking a link sent to their inbox.
If a user forgets their password, they can always `reset password` by following the instructions sent to their email.

Once registered, users can `edit personal information`. 
Users can `add games to their cart` and `buy game keys`, which will be `sent to their email`. 
They can also `view order history`.
Additionally, users can add games to their `favorites` and remove them at any time. 
They can leave a `review` with a rating (1 to 5) and an `optional text comment`. 
The overall game `rating` of each game is `calculated on user reviews`.

### Admin Perspective

Administrators have special permissions.
They can `add`, `edit`, and `delete games`. 
Administrators can also add new `game keys` that users purchase.
Furthermore, they can `assign new administrators` from registered users.
